# Sustaining Membership program

QGIS is an entirely Open Source project. QGIS development is carried out largely by a group of volunteers, that in time have built up a large, valuable and useful code base, free to use and improve for everybody. 

As a result, you have free access to the source code and binaries that we provide on our web site. As a result of this volunteer approach, a number of tasks, less interesting or important for the developers, are sometimes left behind. In addition, promoting QGIS requires our participation at congresses and conferences and the production of information material, sometimes very expensive for volunteer developers.

We would like to extend our activities and improve the quality of QGIS. Your financial contribution will support the maintenance, improvement, and promotion of QGIS. Becoming a sustaining member is a way of ensuring the longevity and overall health of the project.

QGIS.ORG wants to be transparent with the funds we receive and how we spend them. Please have a look at the financial reports and budgets in our [Finance](/community/foundation/finance) section.


## Sustaining membership

Sustaining members can support QGIS for any amount of money of at least 500 €. Sustaining memberships last one year, after which they may be continued with a new payment, or allowed to lapse. Sustaining members have no voting rights (unless they are simultaneously voting members in which case their voting rights are unaffected). At or above the following levels a sustaining member will be designated as being one of the following category, based on their size and assigned through self declaration:

Membership fees are approved or changed by the QGIS general assembly. They are defined as minimum fees per category, but may be increased if the sustaining member chooses to do so.

Because QGIS.ORG is a world-wide project and different companies, NGOs or governmental organizations have different financial prospects, we do not enforce any membership levels - the organizations pick their own membership level based on self-assessment.

Acceptance of sustaining members shall be subject to the discretion and approval of The Board, who reserve the right to accept or reject applications for sustaining membership and ongoing support memberships as deemed appropriate.

### Donation

Donations can be of any amount, via direct transfers to our bank account (SEPA payment), credit card payment (through stripe.com) or Paypal (information available at [Donations](https://donate.qgis.org) page). Even a small donation can make a difference and help to reach important project goals!

If you wish to send us a larger donation, you are strongly encouraged to use the direct transfer (SEPA payment) to our bank account. If you wish to use credit card payments, payments through stripe.com are preferred as payment fees are lower than with PayPal. PayPal payments also imply an unnecessary currency conversion (€ to CHF and back to €) for reasons only PayPal understands.

Donations to QGIS are tax-deductible in some countries (e.g. in Germany through the [German QGIS user group](https://www.qgis.de/#spendenkonto)). Please refer to your local tax office for details.

What is your benefit supporting the QGIS Development?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Supporting the QGIS project as a sustaining member provides the following benefits:

*   Ensures the sustainability and health of the QGIS project.
    
*   Helps with fixing bugs and issues
    
*   All sustaining members and donors will be listed on the project [Sustaining members and Donors](../../../about/sustaining_members.html#qgis-sustaining-members) page, ordered by membership category (flagship, large, medium, small) with a link back to the sustaining members organization or company website and the logo in a size reflecting their membership category.
    
*   flagship, large and medium sustaining members will have their logo on the QGIS homepage footer banner with a logo size and order reflecting their membership category
    
*   sustaining membership logos are listed in the visual changelogs produced for each QGIS software release
    
*   sustaining members will be allowed to use a special version of the QGIS logo on their web site and promotional materials, which shows they are supporting the QGIS project
    
*   No advertising will be placed within the QGIS application itself.
    

Donors will be listed on the [Sustaining members and Donors](../../../about/sustaining_members.html#qgis-sustaining-members) page, but do not receive the additional benefits listed above for sustaining members, except for the first two items.

Decisions on spending of funds will be made by the QGIS Project Steering Committee, proposed in a budget that will be approved or declined by the QGIS.ORG general assembly.

##### Note
We regret that we cannot accept ‘earmarked’ funding as it creates many administrative issues. If you are interested in funding specific aspects of QGIS development, we encourage you to allocate additional human resources to the project, e.g. hiring a developer, or participating to our bug fixing initiative.

##### Warning
Acceptance of sustaining membership applications is at the discretion of the QGIS PSC. We reserve the right to decline offers of sustaining members if the membership organisation or party seems to be at odds with the ethos of our project. For example offers from marketing companies that have nothing to do with GIS / spatial services, or offers where we have reason to believe the presence of the sustaining member logo and marketing materials on our site and other materials will degrade the experience of our users will be declined.
