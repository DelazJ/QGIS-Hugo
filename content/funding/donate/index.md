Below you will find links for different payment forms that we support. Even a small donation can make a difference and help to reach important project goals!

If you wish to send us a larger donation, you are strongly encouraged to use the
direct transfer (SEPA payment) to our bank account. If you wish to use credit card
payments, payments through stripe.com are preferred as payment fees are lower than
with PayPal. PayPal payments also imply an unnecessary currency conversion (€ to CHF and
back to €) for reasons only PayPal understands.

Donations to QGIS are tax-deductible in some countries (e.g. in Germany through the 
[German QGIS user group](https://www.qgis.de/#spendenkonto>)).
Please refer to your local tax office for details.

Donors will be listed on the QGIS sustaining members page,
but do not receive the additional benefits listed above for sustaining members, except for
the first two items.

The payment fees at Stripe are substantially lower than at Paypal - so we would appreciate it, if you could use Stripe instead of PayPal. No signup needed.
