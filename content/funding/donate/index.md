# Support us

QGIS is developed by a team of dedicated volunteers, companies and organisations.

We rely on sponsorships and donations for much of our funding. If you would like to support us, donations are very welcome. Donations can be made by electronic funds transfer, by credit card, or by PayPal.

Donations to QGIS are tax-deductible in several countries. Please refer to your local tax office for details. If you want to tax-deduct as a german company or organization, please donate through the German QGIS user group. They can issue a payment confirmation as a tax-exempt german association.

## Stripe

We use the stripe.com service to receive credit card donations. Note that the payment fees at Stripe are substantially lower than at Paypal - so we would appreciate it, if you could use Stripe instead of PayPal. No signup needed.

## Paypal

You can use Paypal to donate using your own credit card (but we prefer to use Stripe for that). The payment is processed by PayPal but you don't need to have a PayPal account or sign-up for one if you are paying by credit card.

You can also use your own Paypal account to donate.
